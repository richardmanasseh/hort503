# What Do You Know So Far?
variable: reserved memory location to store values
input(): function you use to obtain data from the user
parameter: variables you pass into a function
argument: specific values of the parameters you pass into a function
module: block of reusable code
single ('), double (") and triple (""" .. """): quotes to denote string literals double quote = delineates a sequence of characters
string: a sequence of characters
print(): print function, displays the specified (bracketed) message to the screen
print(f""): Prints formatted data to screen
# pound character, inserts a comment that is to be ignored by python, to comment out code
+ Addition operator: adds two operands
- Subtraction operator: subtracts two operands
/ Division (float) operator: divides the first operand by the second
* Multiplication operator: multiplies two operands
% Modulus operator: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second
< Less than operator: True if left operand is less than the right
<= Less than or equal to operator: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right
> Greater than operator: True if left operand is greater than the right
>= Greater than or equal to operator: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right
= Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand
== Equal to: True if both operands are equal
+= Add AND: Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand
{} In Python, curly braces are used to define a variable inside a string
[] index operator used to make a list
"\" backslash, prefixes a special character to turn it into an ordinary character.
\n  breaks the string print into separate lines
float, decimal number
end=' ', inprint() prints two string lines as one
sys: system library, contains some of the commands one needs in order to work with command-line arguments
argv: argument vector, function Python uses to keep track of the arguments you key in at the command line.
args:
'r' (default) mode to read a file
'w' mode to write a file
'a' mode to append to the file.
'r+' mode to open a file for updating (reading and writing)
def: keyword to create a function
f.read()) function to print the content of a text file
f.readline() function to read the contents of a line
+= an "increment operator"
if: if condition, specifies Boolean expression/proposition
elif: else if condition, specifies additional Boolean propositions
else: else condition, block of code that is executed when the if or elif block is False.
from, import specific parts of a module
import, import a module into use in a script
.append(): method that takes a single item and adds it to the end of the list.
