# Ex 42: Objects, and Classes
# Object-oriented programming breaks a programing problem into objects that interact with each other
# Objects are created from templates known as Classes
# You can think of a class as a blueprint of a building
# An object would be the actual building we build based on the blueprint
# Is-A, Has-A...
