# Ex 1: Print Function
#syntax for print function = print(), and outputs to your console window whatever you say you want to print out.
# Problem: print out your favourite quote. It should give credit to the person who said it on the next line.
# Algorithm:
# Step 1 Define your problem (above).
# Step 2 Algorithms input(s): your favourite quote
                            # name of the person who said it
# Step 3  Define the algorithm's (input and output) variables:
# Step 4 Outline the algorithm's operation(s): print out your favourite quote # call print() function
                                             # print the name of the person who said it on nect line (call print function again)
# Step 5 Output the results (output) of your algorithm's operations:  display your favourite quote on screen
                                                                    # display the name of the person who said it on nect line


print("I am the way, the truth, and the life.") # if you wanted to add an extra line between these two,
print("-Jesus")                                 # would write print("I am the way, the truth, and the life."\n)

print(2)
print(100)
print("t")
print("two")
print("Hello World!")
#print("Hello Again")
#print("I like tying this.")
#print("This is fun.")
#print('Yay! Printing.')
#print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("I \"said\" do not touch this.") #the same type of quote starts and ends the string.
